Warning 1: Model 'or_gate' input port 'enable' has no timing specification (no clock specified to create a sequential input port, not combinationally connected to any outputs, not a clock input)
Warning 2: Model 'or_gate' output port 'active' has no timing specification (no clock specified to create a sequential output port, not combinationally connected to any inputs, not a clock output)
Warning 3: Model 'ste' input port 'enable' has no timing specification (no clock specified to create a sequential input port, not combinationally connected to any outputs, not a clock input)
Warning 4: Model 'ste' output port 'active' has no timing specification (no clock specified to create a sequential output port, not combinationally connected to any inputs, not a clock output)
